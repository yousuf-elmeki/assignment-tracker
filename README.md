# Assignment Tracker

This is my Assignment Tracker web application built for Assignment 3.  
The project implements full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, and EJS templates.  
The website is styled with a simple baby-blue and black color scheme.

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment was to build a complete CRUD application using ExpressJS and MongoDB.  
This application allows users to:

- View all assignments
- Add new assignments
- Edit existing assignments
- Delete assignments (with a confirmation page)
- Use a consistent visual theme across all pages

The application follows the required MVC structure with routes, controllers, models, and views.

## Features

- Baby-blue theme with black text for readability

## Color Scheme

Primary Color: Baby Blue `#cfe8ff`  
Text Color: Black `#000000`  
Form and Table Containers: White `#ffffff`

Reasoning:  
These two colors work really well together. The contrast between the black text and the baby-blue background just makes it pop a bit more.

## Design Choices

- Minimal user interface  
- No header bar to keep the site clean  
- Clearly labeled headings and buttons  
- Simple buttons with black borders and slight hover styling  
- Table layout kept basic and readable  
- White form boxes for logical content separation  
- Back buttons added to reduce navigation frustration
